# Breast-Cancer-Prediction
## 1. Goal
To predict whether the cancer diagnosis is benign or malignant.
## 2. Dataset
Download from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/nsaravana/breast-cancer)

Number of Instances: 569
Columns include Id, 30 attribute variables and a class variable
- Attribute Variables (Mean, standard error and worst value of all listed variables will be included)
